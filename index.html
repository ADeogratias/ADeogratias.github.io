    Hello World!<br>
    I am so happy to see you visiting my website. I am always joyful and I enjoy learning. <br>
    I have just hosted this simple website, and I am really glad to finally cross this off my to-do list. <br>
    Please bear with me as I will be updating it whenever I find the time. This life never warned me about its ability to keeping me busy often. <br>

    Small bio.
    I'm a nature enthusiast with a love for animals, traveling, dancing, music, and art. 
    When not working, you can easily find me playing basketball or taking walks to enjoy the amazing views of Kigali. 
    I'm relatively new to AI but am eager to explore ways to integrate my passion for hardware into simplifying life with AI technology. 
    Currently, I am working on building and deploying a Speech-to-Text deep learning model onto a culturally sensitive social robot at a small lab in Kigali, Rwanda.
